# Machine-Learning-
This repository using for machine learning projects. 

1- Housing Data Operations: 

this project to do exploratory data analysis to understand your dataset and your features, do feature
processing, use machine learning methods on real data, analyze your model and generate predictions using
those methods.
To install the dataset, you need to follow the link below. It will automatically download the .tgz file which
contains the training dataset, available in .csv format.

2- Path Finding â€“ Is there a path?
Traditionally when we are faced with the task of determining whether a given maze has a path or
not we resort to various search or path finding algorithms which are able to answer this question
with absolute certainty. In this project, however, we will take a different approach to solve this
problem by building a classifier that determines (to a certain degree) whether a given maze has a
path or not.

-training_set_positives.p : contains 150 mazes that have a path. Each training example in this file
has a label of 0.
-training_set_negatives.p : contains 150 mazes that do not have a path. Each training example in
this file has a label of 1.

3- Voting Classifier & Stacking
Scikit-Learn provides many helper functions to download popular datasets. MNIST is one of them. In this
project, I use the MNIST dataset. First 60000 instances will form your training set, next 10000
instances will be used to create the validation and test sets.
